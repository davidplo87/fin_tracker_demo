# fin_tracker_demo
This is a demo version of my CIS 411 project. The original project was made with the help of classmates Tanner Wilson and Anna Johns. 

## About the project
The orignial project was intended for a local food business. It's purpose was to track bank activity, organize and categorize expenses, track daily totals from their shop and catering businesses, and display this data to the user in the form of charts and graphs. 

## Changes from the orignial projct
All CSV data has been changed for privacy purposes. Six months worth of sample data is included in this project. The ability to add new CSV data into the Transactions table (Import Bank Activity button) has been disabled.
